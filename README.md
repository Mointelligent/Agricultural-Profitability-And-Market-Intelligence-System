## Agricultural Profitability & Market Intelligence System 🌾📊

This project analyzes agricultural production, logistics, and sales data to uncover insights on crop profitability, transport efficiency, and cost management across regions and farmer groups. The analysis supports data-driven decision-making to help a startup maximize revenue, reduce losses, and improve operational efficiency.

## Project Overview

The startup faced challenges identifying profitable crops, efficient regions, and high-performing farmer groups due to the absence of structured data analysis. This project leverages data analytics to evaluate profitability, logistics costs, and transport losses, enabling better planning and long-term strategic growth.

## Project Objectives
Primary Objective

Identify the most profitable crops and regions to maximize agricultural revenue.

Secondary Objectives

Determine regions with the highest transport losses.

Calculate the average logistics cost per kilogram sold.

Estimate revenue lost due to spoilage or inefficient transport.

Identify the most efficient farmer groups or markets.

## Project Structure

data/ – Raw and cleaned agricultural datasets (Excel/CSV files).

sql/ – SQL queries used for aggregation, filtering, and analysis.

powerbi/ – Power BI dashboard file (.pbix).

images/ – Dashboard screenshots and visual outputs.

README.md – Project documentation.

## Methodology & Analysis
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

Tool: Microsoft Excel

Removed duplicates and inconsistencies

Standardized crop names, regions, and farmer group identifiers

Verified cost, revenue, and quantity values

Prepared a clean dataset for SQL analysis and visualization

2. Data Analysis (SQL)

Tool: SQL

Calculated total revenue, total cost, and profit per crop

Computed logistics cost per kilogram sold

Identified regions with the highest transport losses

Compared profitability across regions and farmer groups

3. Data Visualization & Dashboard (Power BI)

Tool: Microsoft Power BI

Built interactive dashboards to track:

Crop profitability by region

Transport losses across regions

Logistics cost per kg

Farmer group performance

Enabled filtering by crop, region, and farmer group for deeper insights

## Key Insights

High-profit crops: Cassava and Yam

Best-performing regions: West and East

Transport losses and logistics costs significantly reduce overall profitability.

Farmer_23 consistently outperformed others and can serve as a benchmark for best practices.

Inefficient transport and spoilage are major contributors to revenue loss.

## Recommendations
Short-Term Recommendations

Focus planting on high-profit crops such as Cassava and Yam in top-performing regions.

Reduce transport losses by improving logistics coordination.

Track logistics cost per kilogram to identify quick efficiency wins.

Long-Term Recommendations

Invest in storage, transportation, and supply chain infrastructure.

Train farmer groups on efficiency, cost control, and profitability best practices.

Continuously use data-driven tools to optimize crop selection, regional focus, and operational costs.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can transform agricultural decision-making. By identifying profitable crops, efficient regions, and high-performing farmer groups, the startup can reduce losses, improve logistics, and maximize revenue. Data-driven insights provide both immediate operational improvements and a foundation for long-term strategic growth.
